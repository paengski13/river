## River Development Test 2020

Installation Guide

1) Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:paengski13/river.git`
2) Create an .env file and update MySQL credentials accordingly.
3) Next is to run `./deploy-dev.sh`, assuming you already have a working Laravel environment and tools like npm, node and composer are already installed in your machine.

If you encounter any problem, let me know and I will have a look.
